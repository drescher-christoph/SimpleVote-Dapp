# SimpleVote
SimpleVote is a decentralized platform that allows users to create simple votes that can be answered with True or False by the community. This makes it possible to determine opinions and can help in the decision-making process. The current contract was written in Solidity and deployed on the Binance Chain Testnet. To create or participate in an election, the user therefore needs Test BNB.
